# Scope
Due to the permission model of Android, users need to root their devices in order to get full access to their phone. While this would enable user to do many things, running as root is not the brightest idea and does not fit the profile of the average user. Nevertheless, many applications try to exploit a lot of sensitive information, or they expose it to others due to bad implementation.

To counter such phenomena, *Prioxy* crowdsources the settings of a local proxy. *Prioxy* is a proxy which runs locally however, all the user settings about domains and applications are sent to our servers. We *aggregate* these responses to provide you a list with the settings that fit your usage profile best, allowing you to customize it according to your needs, minimizing the notifications that you receive.

Prioxy is developed in the context of [OPERANDO](http://operando.eu/) project.
